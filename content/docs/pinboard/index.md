# pinboard

<component-coghero cog="pinboard" desc="Make a bulletin board pinned message! Users can add/remove their own content to/from a shared, bulletin board style pinned message."></component-coghero>

## Purpose

This cog creates a message by the bot that is shared and editable with the server's members.

The message can contain short introductions and details.

For example, a Pinboard message for "POPULAR GAME Usernames" can be created, and the server members can add to the message with their own usernames.

Multiple Pinboard messages can be created.

Server aliases can be created through Red Bot to create a more seamless command, such as `[p]addPOPULARGAMEusername`
