This Kyarutail cog is a Discord bot for converting text you type into emote letters from Kyaru's tail.

Kyaru, also known as Karyl in the English version, is a character from Priconne (Princess Connect! Re:Dive).

Prerequisites:
- [NQN bot](https://nqn.blue)
- Joining the Kyarutail Discord server


## How it works

It may be troublesome to type or access Kyarutail emotes. This cog will translate text (abc) into emotes (:kyaruA::kyaruB::kyaruC:) for [NQN bot](https://nqn.blue).

This cog does not save or store any images. This cog does not collect user data.

Kyarutail cog is not endorsed by Kyarutail Discord server, the creator of Kyarutail, or Princess Connect! Re:Dive.


## Limitations

Due to a recent Discord update, the old method of directly sending emotes is no longer supported.

The old command is moved to `[p]kyaruself`

This feature replaces the letters you send with <:emote:1234567890>, matching a letter to a provided emote ID. Default emote IDs are from Kyarutail server, though all letters can be changed if you have other letter emotes you'd rather use.
