## About

**CHA-JA is the Japanese Discord bot that delivers language and dictionary information to students, travelers, and anime enthusiasts alike.**

The Japanese language is one of the most intricate and beautiful languages in the world. However, its three scripts - Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana - make it challenging for beginners. Often, learners face difficulties with romanization (Romaji), understanding word definitions, and accessing comprehensive information about vocabulary.

**CHA-JA** is a unified turnkey solution for searching dictionary sources, displaying Romaji pronunciations, word definitions/origins, and links to relevant external sources.

**CHA-JA** uses data from public sources including [Jisho](https://jisho.org/about).


## Getting Started

The public bot invite link is still in development. Please [self-host this bot](/start) or [join the Discord](https://coffeebank.github.io/discord) to stay tuned!
