# coffeetools

<component-coghero cog="coffeetools"></component-coghero>

For now, only the `choose` command has been implemented.

## Choose

This `choose` command uses `|` as the separator, instead of an empty space.

This makes it easier to type multiple words, for e.g.

```
[p]choose Do homework | Procrastinate by making a half finished bot
```
