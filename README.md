## About this repo

This repo was first started as a way to experiment with Discord.py and adapt existing cogs for certain servers. They were often niche and targeted specific pain points, such as `msgmover` and `hellohook`.

These cogs are open-source in the hope that they will be useful, but **[without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.](https://github.com/coffeebank/coffee-cogs/blob/master/LICENSE)**

Please feel free to review code and leave comments! Let me know of broken things, Red updates, and/or suggestions in GitHub Issues.

Allows users specified as mods to send a customized DM embed to users via a User ID.

Uses global settings, so only use this feature on bots hosted for a single server.|
|[emotes](https://coffeebank.github.io/coffee-cogs/emotes)|Custom emote solution for non-nitro users. Use animated emotes in your server, even without Nitro. Make your own emote storage spreadsheet and generate emote-like image links for use in DMs and elsewhere.|

Does not require a user @mention (say '=hug server' all you like!). Includes: blush, cuddle, dance, hug, kiss, lick, neko, nom, pat, poke, slap. Also includes a custom reaction gif builder that works for any gif type from the Purrbot API. To replace built-in hug command, unload 'General' cog and install 'coffeetools' cog.|
|[msgmover](https://coffeebank.github.io/coffee-cogs/msgmover)|Make moving messages between channels/servers easy and integrated, using webhooks. msgcopy: Copy messages from one channel to another. Move whole conversations, or merge channels easily with re-uploaded attachments, bot messages, and usernames/profiles replicated in full. Includes timestamp spacers. msgrelay: Relay messages from one channel to another channel/server.

Updated for Red 3.5|

|[websearch](https://coffeebank.github.io/coffee-cogs/websearch)|A simple Discord bot feature that returns links to search engines like Google without needing to copy-paste a search term into a website/app separately. Comes preset with search strings for Google, Bing, Ecosia, and DuckDuckGo. Custom search strings can be added. Works similarly to LMGTFY, but without the passive aggressiveness.|
|[zidian](https://coffeebank.github.io/coffee-cogs/zidian)|Chinese dictionary bot. Can search Chinese characters, Pinyin, and English. Fetches results locally from saved dictionaries. Uses CC-CEDICT. Inspired by Pleco and Jisho.|
